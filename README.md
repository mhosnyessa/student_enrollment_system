# Project Overview and Architecture

## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to provide a user-friendly interface for students to view, login, sign up, sign out, and apply for programs offered by an educational institute. Additionally, the app facilitates the management of the application process, including handling payments.

## Architecture Overview
The application follows a client-server architecture with the following components:

1. Flutter App: The frontend of the application built using the Flutter framework. It provides a user interface for students to interact with the system.

2. Blog Provider: A state management solution in the Flutter app, responsible for providing data to the UI and handling application state.

3. Repository Layer: The repository layer acts as an intermediary between the data layer and the business logic layer. It communicates with the web server to fetch data and perform necessary operations.

4. Web Server: A containerized web server hosted on Fly.io. The web server is implemented using JavaScript and connects to the MySQL database to fetch and manipulate data as required.

5. MySQL Database: The database hosted on db4free.net. It stores all the necessary information related to programs, students, enrollments, and application data.

## Database Design
The MySQL database plays a crucial role in the application and is designed to store the following main entities:

1. Students: Contains information about the students using the application, including their names, email addresses, and passwords.

2. Programs: Stores details about the available programs offered by the educational institute, including program names, start dates, and end dates.

3. Enrollment: Represents the enrollment of a student in a specific program. It contains the enrollment ID, student ID, program ID, and enrollment date.

## Repository Layer and Data Flow
The repository layer acts as a bridge between the Flutter app and the web server. It handles the communication with the web server and performs operations such as fetching program data, submitting applications, and retrieving application status.

The data flow in the application follows these steps:

1. The Flutter app makes requests to the repository layer to fetch program data or submit applications.

2. The repository layer communicates with the web server via appropriate APIs to fetch the required data or submit the applications.

3. The web server processes the requests, interacts with the MySQL database on db4free.net, and retrieves or updates the necessary information.

4. The web server sends the response back to the repository layer, which further passes it to the Flutter app for display or processing.
